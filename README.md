## Usage

To run the example project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

To use in your project - drag a UIView onto your storybord and set the following runtime attributes: onText, offText,
onColor, and offColor to whatever values you want, and also make sure to set the custom class of the view to
MAMLPopContainerView. Then in the header file of the supporting view controller add:

    #import <MAMLSpringView/MAMLPopContainerView.h>

Everything lays itself out automatically to the container view and should just work.

## Requirements
